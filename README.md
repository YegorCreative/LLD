Scott and Maria Erickson are licensed ministers of the Gospel and founders of Last Days Disciples, a ministry dedicated to making healthy, mature and joyful disciples of Christ that make disciples and so on!  For over 20 years, they have brought healing, hope, and transformation to individuals, couples, and families through their teaching and prayer ministry. With a down-to-earth, kingdom-come theology, Scott and Maria want everyone to know the abundant life Jesus Christ died to give them.  On their weekly radio show The Rest of the Rest, listeners tune in to hear “the rest” of what they may need to know to enter more fully into “the rest” that comes from our inheritance in Christ! You’re invited to tune in to The Rest of the Rest on AM980 at 3:00 PM every Saturday. Hear some laughter, encouragement, and truth that will set your soul free to REST in Christ!
